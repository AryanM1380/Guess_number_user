## Game Rules

1. The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100 as the secret number.
2. It will then make a guess and display it to you.
3. If the guess is higher than the secret number, it will inform you and guess a lower number in the next attempt.
4. If the guess is lower than the secret number, it will inform you and guess a higher number in the next attempt.
5. The process continues until the computer correctly guesses the secret number.
6. Once the computer guesses the correct number, it will display the secret number and end the game.
